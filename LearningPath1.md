# Open Source Simplified - Roadmap 1 

This roadmap is based on an open source project which is used by thousands of people. The open source project name will be revealed only to those who complete all the exercises and the capstone project

## Roles/Skillsets
If you are looking for internships/jobs, these are roles you can apply to if you complete this roadmap
* Python backend developer (FastAPI)
* Gen AI developer

## What is special about this roadmap?
* **This is NOT a generic roadmap**. This roadmap is exclusively based on one open source project, which is used by thousands of people, and only covers topics and subtopics relevant to that project. Completing this roadmap will enable you to reach a skill level where you can easily contribute to that project(and as a side effect other projects which use similar technologies)
* No spoonfeeding - while you will be given topics and exercises, there will be no tutorials. You will have to use the learning resources shared, or any other resource of your choice and solve the exercises.
* Cash prizes - First person to complete all exercises + capstone project + hidden task will win Rs 400, second person Rs 300 and third person Rs 200 (code sharing strictly not tolerated and will lead to immediate disqualification)
  
## Points to Note (Do not skip this)
1. Do not get stuck in tutorial hell Just learn what you need on the go. My prefered approach is
   * Step 1 : Start any topic with a quickstart docs (prefered) or a short quickstart video (less than 25 mins)
   * Step 2 : Directly jump into the exercise. Look at the reference code and if there is any line in the reference code you do not understand then just read the docs for that concept. Make notes as you learn
   * Step 3 : Use your learnings to solve the exercise
   * Step 4 : Submit your exercise and move to the next topic

2. Always read the official docs first. Go for video tutorial only if you do not understand docs. Many libraries have really good official docs. For example, FastAPI docs are really good. This is important because in the real world, you will have to use niche tools and libraries which will not have any video tutorials and will only have docs

3. Make notes as you learn

##### Level 1
Build a FastAPI app which connects to a SQLite database named db. Create a model called Transcription, which has the following fields : id (integer), user_id(integer), transcription(string), processed_text(string), word_count(integer), language(string). The word_count field must have a default value of zero, and the language column must have a value. Create an endpoint /v1/transcriptions, which returns all the transcriptions. Create another endpoint /v1/transcriptions/save , where user can pass user_id and language, and that entry gets added to the SQLite database. Try to use dependency injection to start the SQLalchemy session

#### Level 2
Create a FastAPI app which gets data from any of the public APIs in the link - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis and then caches it using redis, so that when the end users call the same url, they get the same data instantaneously

### Exercise
#### Level 1
Write a simple code which calls LLama-3-8b-8192 model with a user message (any message of your choice) using the Groq API. The Groq API key must be stored in a separate .env file and loaded using the dotenv library
#### Level 2
Convert the above code into a class called MyGroq. The class should have 2 methods
1. Constructor method with one instance attribute called client, which is the Groq object
2. Method called inference, which takes the model_id and prompt as input and returns the response of the LLM API call as the output
Note: Why did I not name the class Groq, and if I want to do that, what can I do?

# Capstone Project 
This capstone project is based on a real world open source project, which you can contribute to once you finish the capstone project
#### Level 1
Given the client code, create a FastAPI app with the following
1. An endpoint /v1/languages which when called return {"languages":["en","hi"]}
2. A websocket endpoint /v1/ws/transcription which receives text from the client, and extracts the user_id and language from the received text. It returns the following response back to the client via the websocket
   {
                   "message_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
                   "text": <the first 20 characters of the audio>
                   "type": <language given by user>
   }

#### Level 2
To the app written in Level 1, add the following features
1. Create a model called Transcription with the following fields : id (integer), user_id(integer), transcription(string), processed_text(string), word_count(integer), language(string)
2. In the /v1/ws/transcription endpoint, add code to store the following set into a Redis database with the key as transcription:{user_id}
   {
                    "transcription": <audio file>              
   }
3. Create an endpoint /v1/transcription/save, which given a user_id, returns all the transcription data corresponding to that user from the Redis database
4. In the above endpoint, write code to add the user, along with their language and transcription data as a new row into a SQLite database by using the Transcription model created in step 1

# Final Task [Locked]
